## My process

### Built with

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Styled Components (for styling)

### What I learned

- Vite: Set up project with vite, a fast build tool which helped improve the development process with the hot module replacement and optimized build process
- Typescript: Enhanced my understanding of typescript which improved the maintainability of my code
- User Experience: Developed a better sense of designing user-friendly interfaces and focusing on responsive design and accessibility.

### Continued development

I want to further broaden my knowledge on React and typescript and build more projects while using vite as the development package due to its fast build process.
